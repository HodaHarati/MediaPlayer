This is a music player app. It shows all your musics, albums and singers in the related tablaout. A bottom Sheet pops up when a song is clicked and It contains next, previous, shuffle and repeat button and also has seek bar.
by click on each album or singer you could see related songs.

The architecture used in this app is MVC. I use Activity, Fragment, Recycler view, Callbacks and bottomsheet in this app. I've used Singletone Design Pattern for repository also I've used Factory design pattern for example newInstance in fragment.
